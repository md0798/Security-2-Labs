The code can be ran using the command:

python cifar10_exp.py

This gives 5 different images as output and saves them as original.png is the original input, fgsm_0.2.png is the input on which fgsm was ran with epsilon=0.2 and np.inf norm, fgsm_2.png is the input on which fgsm was ran with epsilon=2 and 2 norm, pgd_0.2.png is the input on which pgd was ran with epsilon=0.2 with np.inf norm, pgd_2.png is the input on which pgd was ran with epsilon=2 with 2 norm.

The accuracy report has been commented out as it increases the run time of the program drastically, although it can be uncommented in order to get the accuracy report.

The output of fgsm and pgd is clipped from 0 to 1 but it is not multiplied by 255 in this case as matplotlib requires that whenever the input is between 0 and 255 all the values are integers while for float it requires that the values should be between 0 and 1.
